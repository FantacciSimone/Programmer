# Sibilla v1.1

This software update fixes some minor bugs of the previous firmware and brings in general improvements of current functionalities.

## Release date

June 14, 2023

## Bug fixes
* Optimised output LEDs refresh rate with fast LFOs (Boost on);
* Optimised double click behaviour of the center output button to prevent misreadings caused by falling and rising edge of the button press;

## Improvements
* Improved V/oct tracking for accurate pitches;
* Overall potentiometers reading has been improved to prevent unwanted readings and fluctuations;
* Rise and Fall knobs now use a new algorithm to create harmonics and subharmonics for the left and right audio channels and can now scan through way more selections than before: up to 22!
* LFO knob sensitivity has been drastically improved and its rate range is now much wider:
** Boost mode off: roughly from 0.02Hz to 5Hz;
** Boost mode on: 3.3Hz to 150Hz;
